## Installation
*To successfully duplicate this project* 
1. Copy the code above using the bright green **code** button
2. Go into your command prompt and move to your desired directory
3. Enter **git clone "the copied url"**

Now you have cloned successfully. You can copy all downloaded files to a server and from there you can view our project. We have been using our own student sites through https://myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca but there are other options to host your own site. All our pages are php so you may have issues visually if you do not host this code.

## Resources
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

All external sources are linked in our code so there are no required downloads. You will have to find and change certain pages to fit with your own database used.
